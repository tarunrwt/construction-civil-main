# Fix Material Inventory 400 Errors

## Problem
The Material Inventory page is showing 400 errors when trying to:
- Record material usage
- Record material purchases
- Insert new materials

## Root Cause
The database tables (`materials`, `material_usage`, `material_purchases`) either:
1. Don't exist
2. Have incorrect column structure
3. Missing RLS policies
4. Missing proper permissions

## Solution

### Step 1: Apply Database Fix
Run the SQL script `fix_material_inventory_errors.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_material_inventory_errors.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

### Step 2: What This Fix Does

#### ✅ **Recreates Tables with Proper Structure:**
- `materials` table with all required columns
- `material_usage` table for tracking material consumption
- `material_purchases` table for tracking material purchases

#### ✅ **Sets Up Row Level Security (RLS):**
- Users can only see their own materials
- Users can only insert/update/delete their own data
- Proper data isolation between different admin users

#### ✅ **Creates Indexes for Performance:**
- Faster queries on user_id, category, material_id
- Better performance for large datasets

#### ✅ **Adds Automatic Stock Management:**
- Triggers to update stock levels after usage
- Triggers to update stock levels after purchases
- Real-time inventory tracking

#### ✅ **Inserts Sample Data:**
- Sample materials (Cement, Steel Rods, Sand)
- Ready for immediate testing

### Step 3: Test the Fix

After applying the SQL script:

1. **Go to Materials Inventory page**
2. **Try adding a new material** - should work without 400 error
3. **Try recording material usage** - should work without 400 error
4. **Try recording material purchase** - should work without 400 error

### Step 4: Verify Data Isolation

1. **Login as different admin users**
2. **Each admin should only see their own materials**
3. **No cross-contamination of data**

## Expected Results

After applying this fix:
- ✅ No more 400 errors in Material Inventory
- ✅ Materials can be added successfully
- ✅ Usage can be recorded successfully
- ✅ Purchases can be recorded successfully
- ✅ Stock levels update automatically
- ✅ Data isolation works properly
- ✅ Each admin sees only their own data

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check Supabase logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify RLS policies** are enabled
3. **Check user authentication** is working
4. **Ensure all tables were created** successfully

## Files Modified
- `fix_material_inventory_errors.sql` - Complete database fix
- No code changes needed - the issue was purely database-related
