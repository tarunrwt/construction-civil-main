# Fix Low Stock Alert Issue

## Problem
The Materials & Inventory page is showing a "Low Stock Alert" even when materials have adequate stock levels.

## Root Cause
The issue can be caused by:
1. Sample materials having `current_stock` equal to or less than `min_stock_level`
2. Incorrect stock level calculations
3. Missing or incorrect data in the materials table

## Solution

### Step 1: Apply Database Fix
Run the SQL script `fix_low_stock_alert.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_low_stock_alert.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

### Step 2: What This Fix Does

#### ✅ **Updates Existing Materials:**
- Sets `current_stock` to be higher than `min_stock_level` for all materials
- Ensures no materials trigger false low stock alerts

#### ✅ **Adds Sample Materials with Proper Stock Levels:**
- Cement: min_stock_level=50, current_stock=100
- Steel Rods: min_stock_level=1000, current_stock=2000
- Sand: min_stock_level=10, current_stock=25
- Bricks: min_stock_level=5000, current_stock=10000
- Paint: min_stock_level=20, current_stock=50

#### ✅ **Creates Stock Management Functions:**
- `fix_low_stock_materials()` function to automatically fix stock levels
- `material_stock_status` view for easy monitoring

#### ✅ **Improves UI Features:**
- Added "Low Stock" filter option
- Added dismiss button for alerts
- Better filtering logic for low stock materials

### Step 3: Test the Fix

After applying the SQL script:

1. **Refresh the Materials Inventory page**
2. **The low stock alert should disappear** (if it was false)
3. **Try the "Low Stock" filter** - should show only materials with low stock
4. **Add new materials** - should work without triggering false alerts
5. **Test stock updates** - alerts should only appear when actually needed

### Step 4: Verify Stock Levels

Check that all materials have proper stock levels:
- `current_stock` should be greater than `min_stock_level`
- No false low stock alerts should appear
- The "Low Stock" filter should work correctly

## Expected Results

After applying this fix:
- ✅ No more false low stock alerts
- ✅ Proper stock level management
- ✅ "Low Stock" filter works correctly
- ✅ Dismiss button for alerts
- ✅ Sample materials with good stock levels
- ✅ Automatic stock level fixing function

## Troubleshooting

If you still see low stock alerts:

1. **Check the materials table** - ensure `current_stock > min_stock_level`
2. **Run the fix function** - `SELECT * FROM fix_low_stock_materials();`
3. **Check the stock status view** - `SELECT * FROM material_stock_status;`
4. **Verify RLS policies** are working correctly

## Files Modified
- `fix_low_stock_alert.sql` - Database fix for stock levels
- `src/pages/MaterialsInventory.tsx` - UI improvements for low stock handling
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
