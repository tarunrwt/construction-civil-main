2. Click on **"User Management"** button
3. You should see the User Management interface

├── Project Manager (Project oversight)
├── Site Engineer (Daily reporting)
├── Foreman (Team management)
└── Worker (Basic access)
```

### **Your Assignments:**
```
Current Assignments:
├── Project: [Project Name]
├── Role: [Your Role]
├── Assigned: [Date]
└── Permissions: [What you can do]
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **If Everything Works:**
- ✅ **No errors** in the console
- ✅ **Roles load** properly
- ✅ **Projects display** correctly
- ✅ **Assignments show** your current status
- ✅ **Navigation works** smoothly

### **If You See Issues:**
- ❌ **"Failed to fetch user management data"** → Database tables missing
- ❌ **"No roles found"** → `user_roles` table not created
- ❌ **"No assignments found"** → `user_project_assignments` table not created

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **1. "Failed to fetch user management data"**
- **Cause**: Database tables don't exist
- **Solution**: Apply `project_specific_database.sql` in Supabase

#### **2. "No roles found"**
- **Cause**: `user_roles` table is empty
- **Solution**: The database schema should create default roles

#### **3. "No projects found"**
- **Cause**: No projects created yet
- **Solution**: Create projects first in the Projects section

## 🚀 **Quick Test Steps**

1. **Navigate to User Management**
2. **Check if roles load** (should see Admin, Project Manager, etc.)
3. **Check if projects show** (should see your projects)
4. **Check if assignments work** (should see your role assignments)
5. **Try assigning a role** (if you have multiple projects)

## 📋 **Database Requirements**

For User Management to work, you need these tables:
- ✅ `user_roles` - Stores role definitions
- ✅ `user_project_assignments` - Stores user assignments
- ✅ `projects` - Stores project information

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

Your User Management is working if you see:
- ✅ **Role list** with different roles
- ✅ **Project list** with your projects
- ✅ **Assignment table** with your assignments
- ✅ **No error messages**
- ✅ **Smooth navigation**

## 🔍 **Current Status Check**

**To verify everything is working:**
1. Open your app at `http://localhost:8083/`
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Click "User Management"
4. You should see roles, projects, and assignments without errors

**If you see errors, apply the database schema first!** 🗄️✨
